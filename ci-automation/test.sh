# test_run() should be called w/ the positional INPUT parameters below.

# Test scenarios runner stub.
#   This script will run test scenarios for a single image type.
#   Tests will be started inside the mantle container.
#   This script is generic and will use a vendor-specific test runner from
#    "ci-automation/vendor-testing/<image>.sh.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
#   1. SDK version and OS image version are recorded in sdk_container/.repo/manifests/version.txt
#   2. Scripts repo version tag of OS image version to be built is available and checked out.
#   3. Mantle container docker image reference is stored in sdk_container/.repo/manifests/mantle-container.
#   4. Vendor image and torcx docker tarball + manifest to run tests for are available on buildcache
#         ( images/[ARCH]/[FLATCAR_VERSION]/ )
#
# INPUT:
#
#   1. Architecture (ARCH) of the TARGET vm images ("arm64", "amd64").
#   2. Image type to be tested. One of:
#      ami, azure, azure_pro, digitalocean, gce, gce_pro, packet, qemu, qemu_uefi, vmware
#
# OPTIONAL INPUT:
#
#   3. List of tests / test patterns. Defaults to "*" (all tests).
#      All positional arguments after the first 2 (see above) are tests / patterns of tests to run.
#
#   MAX_RETRIES. Environment variable. Number of re-runs to overcome transient failures. Defaults to 20.
#   PARALLEL_TESTS. Environment variable. Number of test cases to run in parallel.
#                   Default is image / vendor specific and defined in ci-automation/ci-config.env.
#
# OUTPUT:
#
#   1. 2 merged TAP reports with all test runs / vendors.
#        - a "summary" report which contains error messages only for tests which never succeeded (per vendor).
#        - a "detailed" report which also contains error messages of transient failures which succeeded after re-runs.
#        These reports will be updated after each (re-)run of each vendor, making the test job safe
#          to abort at any point - the previous runs' results won't be lost.
#   2. All intermediate kola tap reports, kola debug output, and merged tap reports (from 1.) published
#        to buildcache at testing/[VERSION]/[ARCH]/[IMAGE]
#   3. "./ci-cleanup.sh" with commands to clean up temporary build resources,
#        to be run after this step finishes / when this step is aborted.
#
#
# LOW-LEVEL / VENDOR SPECIFIC scripts API
#
# Vendor scripts are provided with their own sub-directory and are expected to CD into there before
#  creating any artifacts (see vendor script argument 1 below).
# The torcx manifest is supplied in
#   ../
# relative to the vendor sub-directory. The manifest is updated to include a URL pointing to the docker
#  torcx tarball on the build cache (for the docker.torcx-manifest-pkgs test).
#
# Vendor specific scripts are called with the following positional arguments:
# 1 - Toplevel tests directory
#     It contains some additional files needed for running the tests (like torcx manifest or file with channel information).
# 2 - Working directory for the tests.
#     The vendor script is expected to keep all artifacts it produces in that directory.
# 3 - Architecture to test.
# 4 - Version number to test.
# 5 - Output TAP file.
# All following arguments specify test cases / test case patterns to run.
#
# The vendor tests should source ci-automation/vendor_test.sh script
# as a first step - it will do some common steps that the vendor
# script would need to make anyway. For more information, please refer
# to the vendor_test.sh file.

# Download torcx package and manifest, add build cache URL to manifest
#  so the docker.torcx-manifest-pkgs test can use it.
